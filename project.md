For our e-commerce project, we implemented a robust CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins. 
Whenever a developer pushes code to our Git repository, the pipeline automatically builds the application, 
runs unit and integration tests, and deploys the changes to our staging environment. 
We use Terraform to manage our infrastructure on AWS, ensuring consistency and reproducibility. 
To monitor the application's performance, we were using Prometheus and Grafana, 
which provide real-time insights into metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, and response times.

# Componets of project
frontend: javascript, react
backend : java
Infrastructure : GCP

# Iac
we are using terraform for infrastructure provisioning
used terraform for creating vpc, subnet,vm,firewall,load balancer , storage bucket.

# ansible 
we are using ansible for configuration management
deploy application dependencies
configuring  web servers nginx
application server tomcat
automate update servers

# CI/CD
1) Code Commit:
Developer commits code changes to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

2) Jenkins Trigger:
Jenkins is configured to trigger a build pipeline automatically on code pushes or scheduled intervals.

3) Maven Build:
Jenkins executes a Maven build to compile the Java code, run unit tests, and package the application as a JAR or WAR file.

4)Artifact Repository:
The built artifact is uploaded to JFrog Artifactory for storage and distribution.

5) Docker Image Build:
A Dockerfile is used to create a Docker image containing the application and its dependencies.
Jenkins builds the Docker image and pushes it to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Google Container Registry).

6) Kubernetes Deployment:
Jenkins triggers a Kubernetes deployment to deploy the Docker image to a GKE cluster.
Kubernetes handles the scaling, load balancing, and self-healing of the application.

# for security 
Vulnerability Scanning using 
Google Cloud: Security Command Center (SCC)
AWS: Amazon Inspector

Best Practices:

Regular Scanning: Conduct regular vulnerability scans to identify new vulnerabilities.
Prioritize Fixes: Prioritize fixing critical vulnerabilities.
Keep Software Updated: Keep all software and libraries up-to-date with the latest security patches.


Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
Purpose: To monitor network traffic for signs of malicious activity.

Tools:
Google Cloud: Cloud IDS
AWS: Amazon GuardDuty

Best Practices:
Real-time Monitoring: Monitor network traffic in real-time.
Alerting: Set up alerts for suspicious activity.
Incident Response: Have a well-defined incident response plan.

Firewalls
Purpose: To filter network traffic and protect your infrastructure from unauthorized access.

Tools:
Google Cloud: Cloud Firewall
AWS: AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)

Best Practices:
Strong Firewall Rules: Implement strong firewall rules to block unwanted traffic.
Regular Review: Regularly review and update firewall rules.
Logging and Monitoring: Monitor firewall logs for suspicious activity.

Penetration Testing
Purpose: To simulate attacks on your system to identify weaknesses.

Tools:
Google Cloud: Security Command Center (SCC)
AWS: Amazon Inspector

Best Practices:
Regular Testing: Conduct regular penetration tests.
Prioritize Fixes: Prioritize fixing critical vulnerabilities identified during testing.
Engage a Qualified Team: Hire a skilled penetration testing team.
